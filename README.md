# Financial Analysis using Python 
#### Examples from my learning 

Recently, as part of my Data Science and Data Analtics learning, I have spent some good time doing some practical exercises to understand the concepts. Happy to share those here.

## Pre requisites
- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.x 

## Data Wrangling and Visualization
### Use Case 1
Say, If I want to understand how the GDP of a country performed over the years. Once I am able to retreive and plot the result, I would like to add the GDP data for more countries and understand the story of the progress of individual countries and then how it compares to the other.
